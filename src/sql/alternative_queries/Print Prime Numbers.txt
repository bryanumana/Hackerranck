Write a query to print all prime numbers less than or equal to 1000.
Print your result on a single line, and use the ampersand (&) character as your separator (instead of a space).

For example, the output for all prime numbers <= would be:

2&3&5&7

SOLUTION:
WITH RECURSIVE numbers AS (
    SELECT 2 AS n
    UNION ALL
    SELECT n + 1 FROM numbers WHERE n < 1000
),
prime_numbers AS (
    SELECT n FROM numbers WHERE NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM numbers AS divs WHERE divs.n < numbers.n AND divs.n > 1 AND numbers.n % divs.n = 0
    )
)
SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(n ORDER BY n SEPARATOR '&') FROM prime_numbers;
