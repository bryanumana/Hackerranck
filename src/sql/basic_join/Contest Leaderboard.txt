You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!

The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges.
Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score.
If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the result by ascending hacker_id.
Exclude all hackers with a total score of  from your result.

SOLUTION:
SELECT
    t.id,
    h.name,
    SUM(t.max_sum) AS total_sum
FROM hackers AS h
JOIN (
    SELECT
        s.hacker_id AS id,
        MAX(s.score) AS max_sum
    FROM submissions AS s
    GROUP BY s.hacker_id, s.challenge_id
) AS t
ON h.hacker_id = t.id
GROUP BY t.id, h.name
HAVING total_sum <> 0
ORDER BY total_sum DESC, t.id;
