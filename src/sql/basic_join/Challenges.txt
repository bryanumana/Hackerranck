Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges.
Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of challenges created by each student.
Sort your results by the total number of challenges in descending order.
If more than one student created the same number of challenges, then sort the result by hacker_id.
If more than one student created the same number of challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges created,
then exclude those students from the result.

SOLUTION:
WITH ChallengeCount AS (
    SELECT
        c.hacker_id,
        h.name,
        COUNT(c.challenge_id) AS total_challenges
    FROM Challenges c
    JOIN Hackers h ON c.hacker_id = h.hacker_id
    GROUP BY c.hacker_id, h.name
),
Ranked AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_challenges DESC) AS rnk
    FROM ChallengeCount
)
SELECT hacker_id, name, total_challenges
FROM Ranked
WHERE rnk = 1 OR total_challenges NOT IN (
    SELECT total_challenges
    FROM Ranked
    GROUP BY total_challenges
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
    AND total_challenges < (SELECT MAX(total_challenges) FROM Ranked)
)
ORDER BY total_challenges DESC, hacker_id;
