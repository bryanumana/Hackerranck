Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels.
Your result cannot contain duplicates.

The STATION table is described as follows:
| Field  | Type         |
| ID     | NUMBER       |
| CITY   | VARCHAR2(21) |
| STATE  | VARCHAR2(2)  |
| LAT_N  | NUMBER       |
| LONG_W | NUMBER       |

SOLUTION:
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE LOWER(SUBSTRING(CITY, 1, 1)) NOT IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
