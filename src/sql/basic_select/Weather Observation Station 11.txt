Query the list of CITY names from STATION that either do not start with vowels
or do not end with vowels.
Your result cannot contain duplicates.

The STATION table is described as follows:
| Field  | Type         |
| ID     | NUMBER       |
| CITY   | VARCHAR2(21) |
| STATE  | VARCHAR2(2)  |
| LAT_N  | NUMBER       |
| LONG_W | NUMBER       |

SOLUTION:
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE (LOWER(SUBSTRING(CITY, 1, 1)) NOT IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')) OR
(LOWER(SUBSTRING(CITY, -1)) NOT IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'))
