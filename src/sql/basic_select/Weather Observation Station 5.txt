Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names,
as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name).
If there is more than one smallest or largest city,
choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

The STATION table is described as follows:
| Field  | Type         |
| ID     | NUMBER       |
| CITY   | VARCHAR2(21) |
| STATE  | VARCHAR2(2)  |
| LAT_N  | NUMBER       |
| LONG_W | NUMBER       |

SOLUTION:
-LENGTH= Sirve para contar el número de elementos que componen el tipo varchar

//Más corto = De menor a mayor y alfabeticamente en caso de empate
SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) AS NameLength
FROM STATION
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY), CITY
LIMIT 1;

//Más largo = De mayor a menor y alfabeticamente en caso de empate
SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) AS NameLength
FROM STATION
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC, CITY
LIMIT 1;
