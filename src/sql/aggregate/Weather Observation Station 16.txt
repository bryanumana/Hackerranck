Query the smallest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) from STATION that is greater than 38.7780.
Round your answer to 4 decimal places.

The STATION table is described as follows:
| Field  | Type         |
| ID     | NUMBER       |
| CITY   | VARCHAR2(21) |
| STATE  | VARCHAR2(2)  |
| LAT_N  | NUMBER       |
| LONG_W | NUMBER       |

SOLUTION:
SELECT ROUND(MIN(LAT_N), 4) AS truncated_min
FROM STATION
WHERE LAT_N > 38.7880
