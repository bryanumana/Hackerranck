A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half.
Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to  decimal places.

The STATION table is described as follows:
| Field  | Type         |
| ID     | NUMBER       |
| CITY   | VARCHAR2(21) |
| STATE  | VARCHAR2(2)  |
| LAT_N  | NUMBER       |
| LONG_W | NUMBER       |

SOLUTION:
SELECT ROUND(AVG(LAT_N), 4) AS median_lat_n
FROM (
    SELECT LAT_N,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY LAT_N) AS row_num,
           COUNT(*) OVER () AS total_count
    FROM STATION
) AS subquery
WHERE row_num IN (FLOOR((total_count + 1) / 2), FLOOR((total_count + 2) / 2));
