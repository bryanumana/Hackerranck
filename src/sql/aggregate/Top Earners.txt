We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly salary x months worked,
and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table.
Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings.
Then print these values as 2 space-separated integers.

The Employee table containing employee data for a company is described as follows:
| Column      | Type    |
| employee_id | Integer |
| name        | String  |
| months      | Integer |
| salary      | Integer |

SOLUTION:
SELECT
    MAX(salary * months) AS max_earnings,
    COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM
    Employee
WHERE
    salary * months = (SELECT MAX(salary * months) FROM Employee);
