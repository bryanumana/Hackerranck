Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table,
but did not realize her keyboard's 0 key was broken until after completing the calculation.
She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation
(using salaries with any zeros removed)
and the actual average salary.
Write a query calculating the amount of error
and round it up to the next integer.

The Employee table containing employee data for a company is described as follows:
| Column | Type    |
| ID     | Integer |
| name   | String  |
| salary | Integer |

SOLUTION:
-CEIL(): Función que reondea el número al entero más cercano
-REPLACE(CAST(Salary AS CHAR), '0', ''): Vuelve la cadena como caracteres y luego los reemplaza


SELECT
    CEIL(AVG(Salary) - AVG(CAST(REPLACE(CAST(Salary AS CHAR), '0', '') AS UNSIGNED))) AS Error
FROM EMPLOYEES;
