Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W) for the largest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION
that is less than 137.2345.
Round your answer to 4 decimal places.

The STATION table is described as follows:
| Field  | Type         |
| ID     | NUMBER       |
| CITY   | VARCHAR2(21) |
| STATE  | VARCHAR2(2)  |
| LAT_N  | NUMBER       |
| LONG_W | NUMBER       |

SOLUTION:
SELECT ROUND(LONG_W, 4) AS rounded_longitude
FROM STATION
WHERE LAT_N = (
    SELECT MAX(LAT_N)
    FROM STATION
    WHERE LAT_N < 137.2345
);
