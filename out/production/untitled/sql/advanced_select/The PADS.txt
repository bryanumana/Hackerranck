Generate the following two result sets:

1. Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS,
immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical
For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).

2. Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS.
Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:
There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.
where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS
and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name.
If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.

The OCCUPATIONS table is described as follows:
| Column     | Type   |
| Name       | String |
| Occupation | String |

SOLUTION:
-CONCAT: Con esta función se pueden concatenar cadenas de texto
-COUNT(*):Cuenta el número de ocurrencias de cada ocupación
-GROUP BY Occupation: Groups the rows by the Occupation column to calculate the count for each occupation.

SELECT CONCAT(NAME, '(', LEFT(Occupation, 1), ')') AS formatted_name
FROM OCCUPATIONS
ORDER BY Name ASC;

SELECT CONCAT(
    'There are a total of ',
    COUNT(*),
    ' ',
    LOWER(Occupation),
    's.'
) AS occupation_summary
FROM OCCUPATIONS
GROUP BY Occupation
ORDER BY COUNT(*), Occupation ASC;
